# Anagram

Program in which you choose the size of an array (MxN), then insert letters x=M*N (with a space between the characters), and after that, it prints the rows in which the letters can be read in both ways (e.x  a m m a ).

An example of the output is given below:

//

Give the dimensions of the array (columns x rows) 
4 5
Give the characters: 
b c c b e f g t i o u u o l l o l j u i

The matrix is :
b c c b
e f g t
i o u u
l j u i
o l l o

40% (2/5) of the matrix rows are anagrams. Those are:
[0] b c c b 
[4] o l l o
